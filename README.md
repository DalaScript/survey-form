# Survey Form (Certification Project) | FCC Responsive Web Design Certification

**Project 5/20**

A stylish and fully responsive **survey form** built from scratch using HTML and CSS.
It features a modern dark theme, a clean layout, and custom UI elements like dropdowns, checkboxes, and text inputs — all wrapped in an aesthetic, user-friendly design.

This project was built independently, following a general task prompt, without any templates or starter files. 🎯
